You also acknowledge that the security and control procedures provided by us are designed to verify the source of communication and not to detect errors in transmission and content including discrepancies between names and account numbers and that we, or any intermediary, may execute an instruction by reference to account number only, even if the name on the account is also provided. Nothing contained here in shall require us to violate any applicable laws, rules or regulations on the transfer of funds or data transmission.

We may acknowledge your instructions by such means as we consider appropriate whether orally, in writing, by actual performance or otherwise. We are under no obligation to accept any instructions that are from your officers, directors, managers, partners or shareholders who are not your authorized representatives according to our records.

**8.4** You shall promptly (and within any time limit imposed by us) give instructions we may reasonably request from you in respect of any services provided hereunder. If you do not do so, we may in our sole discretion take any steps at your cost which we consider appropriate for our or for your protection. You shall be liable for all errors of transmission and for all consequences of electronic, mechanical and other transmission failures.

**9 Dealing**

**9.1** We may arrange for you to open and maintain an investment account (the “Account”) for you to enable you to invest in the Securities from time to time.

**9.2** We may execute your dealing instructions upon any market or exchange and through any clearing house selected by us, including executing a transaction which is not regulated by any stock exchange, unless specifically instructed by you to the contrary.

**9.3** Assets and profits arising on settlement or liquidation will be credited to your Account and losses will be debited to your Account. Any debt balance arising as a result of settlement or liquidation will be payable by you forthwith whether or not demanded by us.

**9.4** We shall be entitled to carry out all transactions in accordance with the constitution by laws, rules, regulations, customs or practices of the relevant market, exchange and/or clearing house and with applicable laws whether imposed on you or us. We may take all such steps as may be required or permitted by such laws, rules, regulations, customs and/or market practice. We will be entitled to take or not take any reasonable action we consider fair in order to ensure compliance with the same and all such actions so taken will be binding upon you.

**9.5** We will not knowingly execute or agree to execute a transaction which would result in your having a short position. A short position arises when a person contracts to sell investments which he/she does not currently own, intending to buy them in the market at a lower price, before the investments are due to be derived to the purchaser.

**9.6** In order to give effect to your dealing instructions, we may instruct an intermediate broker selected by us in our discretion which may be an Associate. We undertake to use reasonable care and skill in the appointment and supervision of any other intermediate broker and to make available to you and take such action on your behalf as you may reasonably request in relation to any rights we have against such intermediate broker subject to this we accept no liability for default of any intermediate broker or exchange clearing house marker or depository.

**9.7** In executing transactions for you, we may in our absolute discretion deal with you as principal or agent.

**9.8** We may at our discretion aggregate your orders with our own orders or those of other clients of ours or our Associates. We will allocate the proceeds of such orders among the participating accounts in a manner which we believe to be fair and equitable. If the combined order is not executed at the same price we may average net price. Details of average price will be furnished on request. Such allocation may take place within one business day of execution. In aggregating your orders in this way, we must reasonably believe this will be to your advantage, for instance to obtain better execution or reduced foreign exchange or other dealing costs by being part of a larger transaction. However, on occasion, aggregation and allocation may result in you obtaining a less favourable price.

**9.9** Where we are unable to consider it to be undesirable or inappropriate to execute your order at once or in a single transaction we may execute it over such period as we deem appropriate and we may report to you an average price for a series of transactions so executed instead of the actual price of each transaction.

**9.10** We may undertake a programme trade or trades comprising a single transaction series of transactions on your behalf. In doing so we may act as principal or agent but will not be required to notify you in which of these capacities we are executing the transaction.

**9.11** The purchase, sale, redemption and conversion of Securities may be subject to minimum transaction size or value, and may have to be consolidated with similar transactions of other clients, and may only be implemented by us if such minimum size or value transaction is achieved.

**9.12** Transactions relating to Securities will in addition to the terms and conditions herein, be determined and governed by the terms and conditions of the issuer of the Securities including limitations relating to investment level, tenor, cost, procedure and frequency of purchase, sale, redemption, conversion and valuation, and you agree to read and otherwise familiarize yourself with and to be bound by the terms and conditions of the issuer of the Security.

**10 Confirmations**

**10.1** We will send to you confirmation in respect of each transaction in accordance with applicable law or within a reasonable period. If we have instructed an intermediate broker on your behalf, the confirmation may be a copy of the confirmation sent to us by the intermediate broker. When dealing in collective investments on your behalf we are authorized to receive confirmation notes from the manager and we will issue our own confirmation to you. Confirmations posted, electronically transmitted or otherwise sent to you at your last known address in our records will be deemed to have been received by you when sent to the relevant address.

**10.2** Any confirmations which we give in writing will be deemed correct, conclusive and binding on you if not objected to in writing within thirty business days of delivery to you of the confirmation or we notify you of an error therein within the same time period.

**CLIENT ASSETS**

**11 Custody**

**11.1** Where we provide you with a custody service, we shall appoint a Custodian to perform custody services and the following provisions will apply to those of your investments so held by us.

**11.2** All investments purchased through us will be registered (except for bearer stocks) in the name of our nominee or the name of another custodian appointed by us unless otherwise indicated we will account to you for all dividends, interest payments and other rights accruing to you. Bearer or other non-registered investments may not always be held by us directly but may be held by one or more third parties (including clearing systems, custodians and overseas agents) directly or indirectly, and may be for its or their account.

**11.3** You should note that in some instances nominee account holders will not receive certain entitlements, such as annual reports and accounts, nor attend annual (or other) meetings and vote at such meetings.

**11.4** Overseas investments may be registered or recorded in the name of a custodian or in our name (subject to your prior written consent) in one or more jurisdictions outside Kenya where we determine that, due to legal requirements or the nature of market practice in the jurisdictions concerned, it is in your best interests or it is not feasible to do otherwise. As a consequence of this your investments will not be segregated from investments belonging to us or our other clients and therefore your protection may be less should a default occur on the part of the person in whose name the investments are registered or recorded. Investments belonging to you which are held overseas may be subject to different settlement, legal and regulatory requirements than those which apply in Kenya.

**11.5** We are responsible for the acts of our nominee to the same extent as for our own acts. We accept no liability for the default of any nominees, custodians or third parties.

**11.6** Should you instruct us in writing that investments purchased through us be registered in the name of some other person whom you specify, the consequences of registration carried out in accordance with your instructions are entirely at your risk.

**11.7** Investments registered or recorded in the name of a nominee will be pooled with those of one or more of our other clients. Accordingly, your individual entitlements may not be identifiable by separate certificates, physical documents or entries on the register or equivalent electronic records. In the event of an irreconcilable shortfall following any default or failure by the custodian responsible for pooled investments, you may not receive your full entitlement and may share in that shortfall pro-rata to your original share of the assets in the pool. When corporate events (such as partial redemptions) affect some but not all of the investments held in a pooled account we will allocate the investments so affected to particular customers in such fair and equitable manner as we consider appropriate (which may without limitation involve pro rata allocation or an impartial lottery).

**11.8** We will provide you with information relating to your investments held by us by sending periodic statements no less often than every 6 months. Assets will be valued in accordance with general market practice or, subject to our prior agreement, in accordance with your instructions.

**11.9** We will collect any dividends, interest, payments or other entitlements to which you may be entitled and of which we are notified and will remit to you such dividends or interest as soon as possible after deduction of any taxes and duties payable or credit them to your account.

**11.10** Provided it is practical and expedient, we will endeavor to obtain your instructions for exercising or dealing with any of the following matters in relation to your investments of which we receive notice.

**11.10.1** conversion or subscription rights;

**11.10.2** takeovers or other offers or capital reorganizations

**11.10.3** voting rights

**11.11** The consequences of a failure on your part to provide instructions to us by any required time once notification of such an event has been sent to you are your sole responsibility. If we are unable to obtain your instructions we will be under no obligations to take any action but may, in good faith and at our discretion and without any liability thereof, use our judgment and act as we think fit in relation to any rights and/or privileges attaching to any investments held on your behalf.

**11.12** Where we appoint a custodian for holding your investment it may be another company in the group of companies to which we belong.

**12 Client Money**

**12.1** Should any of your money be received or held on your behalf by us it will be treated as client money.

**12.2** We may hold client money at a bank which is not an approved bank if:

**12.2.1** The client moneys relate to the settlement of a transaction or the distribution of income subject to the law or market practice of a jurisdiction outside Kenya.

**12.2.2** Because of the law or practice of that jurisdiction it is not possible to hold client money in a client bank account with an approved bank; and

**12.2.3** We hold the money with such bank no longer than is reasonably necessary to effect the transaction or a series of transactions.

**12.3** Your money may be passed to a settlement agent, intermediate broker or other person such as an exchange or clearing house. You acknowledge that we may pass client money to such a person outside Kenya in which case the legal and regulatory regime applying to such person(s) will be different to that of Kenya and in the event of a failure of that person your money may be treated in a different manner from that which would apply if it were held at an account in Kenya.

**12.4** You consent to our releasing any client money balances of yours for such use as we in our discretion determine provided there has been no movement on such balances for at least 5 years (notwithstanding any payments or receipts of charges interest or similar items) and we will therefore not be obliged to treat such money as client money.

**SETTLEMENT AND POWERS OF DEFAULT**

**13 Settlement**

**13.1** You will take all action necessary to enable us to effect settlement and delivery of transactions as they fall due in accordance with the requirements of the relevant exchange market or clearing house including but not limited to making any appropriate payment and or delivering any Securities or other assets to us in good time for us to complete settlement and delivery. If any payment or delivery is not received or is incomplete or incorrect when received we will not complete the transaction or we may without notice liquidate the transaction or buy in the market in order to meet our or your performance obligations or take such other actions as we in our absolute discretion may consider appropriate.

**13.2** If you have more than one account with us, we will have the right to set off the debit on one account against the credit on another. If the accounts are expressed in different currencies they shall be translated to currency of the debt at the prevailing rate of exchange.

**13.3** Any crediting to your account of cash or investment is subject to reversal, if in accordance with local laws and practice, the delivery of investments or cash giving rise to the credit is reversed.

**14 Default and realization of clients’ assets**

**14.1** Any sums due to us in respect of commissions, costs, fees, expenses or otherwise pursuant to this agreement (plus any applicable VAT) may be withdrawn on prior notice to you from any portfolio or assets of yours held by us or under our control and we may have recourse against and sell realize or dispose any of such assets and apply the proceeds in or towards discharge of such sums. You hereby give us authority to direct any third party custodians holding such assets to make payment of all invoices and other requests for payment in respect thereof presented to it by us.

**14.2** Without prejudice to clause 14.1 if we do not receive either cash or securities when due in respect of any transaction which we are to settle or execute with or for you, or you do not take all steps necessary to secure the due and prompt execution and settlement of any such transaction, or you fail to meet or believe in good faith that you are about to fail to meet any other liability to us or any third party we may on giving you 3 days prior notice thereof cancel, close out, terminate or reverse all or any contracts, buy in to settle or close any short position created by you, and sell, realize, charge, pledge or otherwise dispose of any investments, cash or any assets held for you or which we may be entitled to receive or control on your behalf at whatever price and in whatever manner we see it fit in our absolute discretion (without being responsible for any loss or diminution in price) and may enter into any other transaction or do or not do anything (including the application of client money held for you) which would or could have the effect of reducing or eliminating liability under any transaction, position or commitments undertaken by or for you.

**14.3** We shall not be liable to you in respect of any loss arising nor in respect of any choice made by us in selecting the investments sold or disposed of. The proceeds of any sale or disposal of such assets (net of costs) will be applied in or towards discharge of your liabilities and we will account for you for any balance. In the event that such proceeds of sale are insufficient to cover the whole of your liabilities, you remain liable for the balance.
