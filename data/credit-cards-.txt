* **What is credit card balance transfer? Or How credit card balance transfer works?**
    A balance transfer is as the name suggests. It allows you to transfer your remaining outstanding balance to another bank at a much lower, or sometimes even 0% interest rate over a fixed period of time, which is often offered by banks to new customers. Of course, there may be processing fees involved which would impact the EIR, but if you make your repayments on time on the new card, you can avoid traditional credit card interest rates. Taking on a balance transfer plan on a credit card essentially buys you more time to pay off the loans without worrying about paying high interest.
    Balance transfer plans are often offered in 3, 6, or 12-month repayment periods, and require you to pay a minimum amount (about 2.5 or 3% of your remaining outstanding balance) each month. At Standard Chartered Bank, this amount can be as low as 1%. In the final month of the balance transfer loan period, you are expected to pay off the remaining amount in full.
* **What is a virtual credit card?**
    A virtual credit card is an electronic card which can be created using the bank’s net banking facility, by providing one’s credit card details. A virtual credit card is safe and secure for all online transactions. You can simply save the card details on your smartphone and use it from anywhere without any hassle.
* **What is CVV in credit card?**
    A CVV is the three-digit number on your card that adds an extra layer of security when making purchases online or over the phone.
* **What is the difference between credit card and debit card?**
    Debit cards allow bank customers to spend money by drawing on funds they have deposited at the bank. Credit cards allow consumers to borrow money from the card issuer up to a certain limit in order to purchase items or withdraw cash.
* **How to block credit card?**
    1. Login to the SC Mobile App
    2. Select “Service Requests”
    3. Go to “Card Management”
    4. Select “Report Lost/Stolen Credit Card”
