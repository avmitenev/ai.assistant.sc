Standard Chartered is committed to building a sustainable business in Kenya.

**Our Approach**

We aim to embed sustainable practices through our business, operations and communities.

*   ### Sustainable Finance 
    As a leading financial institution, we promote sustainable finance in our markets. We’re committed to supporting sustainable economic growth, expanding renewables financing and investing in sustainable infrastructure where it is needed most.
*   ### Responsible Company 
    We strive to be a responsible company, fighting financial crime, minimising our environmental impact, investing in our people and embedding our values across our business in the markets where we operate.
*   ### Inclusive Communities 
    We promote economic inclusion in our markets, delivering community programmes aimed at tackling inequality. Through Futuremakers by Standard Chartered, we support young people to learn new skills, get job-ready and start their own businesses.
