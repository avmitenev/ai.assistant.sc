## Standard Chartered Kenya - Sustainable Finance

Moving capital to where it matters most

The world must act now if it is to deliver the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for a more sustainable society by 2030.

Yet, just 60 per cent of the financing needed to achieve the 17 Goals in low and middle-income countries is being met. In Africa, this is as low as 10 per cent.

Innovation has been our hallmark for 160 years and we are determined to use our expertise to direct capital to where it is needed most.

Our footprint in Asia, Africa and the Middle East includes some of the markets worst hit by environmental and social challenges. We want to make the world a better, cleaner and safer place and minimise the negative impact of our financing. In other words, do more good and less harm.
