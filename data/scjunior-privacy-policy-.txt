**Managing children’s information**

In accordance with the DPA, as we will be knowingly collecting personal data from children under 18 years of age when offering the App, we must obtain verifiable parental/legal guardian/guardian consent (“Consent”).

We believe that children should be able to use the Internet in a safe, productive and efficient manner and should be afforded the highest protection available with respect to their personal data. Accordingly, as part of the sign-up process, the App ensures that the individual registering for the account is a parent, legal guardian or guardian of the child that will use the App, and that the parent, legal guardian and guardian is over 18 years of age.

We also abide by the principles of data minimisation and do not collect more personal data than is necessary from any individual in order to participate in an activity. In addition:

*   We take steps to prevent children from posting or publicly disclosing personal data.
*   You as parent, legal guardian or guardian can edit, update or delete your child’s/guardian personal data within the App.
*   You can revoke your consent and refuse the further use or collection of personal data from your child/guardian.
*   Should you wish to access or delete the information we have collected from your child/guardian (subject to our record-keeping obligations under applicable law), you can do so by deleting your child’s/guardian profile from within the App or by contacting us by email at [scjunior.privacy@sc.com](mailto:scjunior.privacy@sc.com).

**Cookies & similar technologies**

In order to improve the content and format of the App and the quality of our services in general, we may utilise cookies and similar tracking technologies and work with third parties to capture and analyse App usage and activity information. This includes how often the App is used, the events that occur within the App, movements on the App, aggregated usage, performance data, device location, the type of device used, and from where the App was downloaded. This is to enable us to measure user preferences, analyse trends, administer the App, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link the information to any personal data within the App. To choose what cookies you want to accept select **Manage cookies.** To accept all cookies for the best possible experience select **Accept all.** If you’d like to learn more about how we use cookies and to manage your selection visit our Cookie Policy: [https://av.sc.com/ke/content/docs/sc-ke-cookies-policy.pdf](https://av.sc.com/ke/content/docs/sc-ke-cookies-policy.pdf)

**Choice and control**

You, as the parent, legal guardian and guardian of the child using the App, has the choice of providing, editing or removing certain information about your child, as well as choices about how we contact you about your child’s/guardian usage of the App.

You may also control the receipt of certain types of communications from us in your account and the App settings.

We do not process any of your child’s/guardian personal data for marketing purposes.

**International data transfers**

To facilitate our global operations, you acknowledge and agree that we may transfer, store and process your child’s/guardian personal data outside of your country of residence. Where we do so, we ensure that the appropriate safeguards are in place, and that there are commensurate data protection laws in the jurisdiction to which your child’s/guardian personal data is being transferred.

**Security and storage of personal data**

The security of your child’s/guardian personal data is important to us. We have technical and organisational security measures in place to safeguard your child’s/guardian personal data. When using external service providers, we require that they adhere to security standards mandated by us. We may do this through contractual provisions, including any approved by a privacy regulator, and oversight of the service provider. Regardless of where personal data is transferred, we take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that personal data is kept securely.  
You should be aware that the Internet is not a secure form of communication and you must not send us (and should ensure that your child does not send us) any personal data over the Internet as this carries with it risks including the risk of access and interference by unauthorised third parties. Information passing over the Internet may be transmitted internationally (even when sender and recipient are located in the same country) via countries with weaker privacy and data protection laws than in your country of residence.

**Data Retention**

We retain your child’s/guardian personal data in line with our legal and regulatory obligations and only for lawful business and operational purposes.

**Data Subject Rights**

The DPA governs the processing of personal data and provides for the data subject’s rights. You will have the following rights with regards to your child’s/guardian personal data:

**Correction**

**Erasure**

In some circumstances, you have the right to ask us to delete your child’s/guardian personal data without undue delay, for example if we no longer have the authority to retain it or a valid reason to process it.

**Object**

In some circumstances you may have the right to object to how we process your child’s/guardian personal data or to withdraw your consent to the processing of your child’s/guardian personal data. If you have any concerns about how we process your child’s/guardian personal data, please discuss this at your branch or with your Relationship Manager. We may not be able to offer you the App if you do not want us to process the personal data we consider necessary to provide and operate the App.

**Restriction**

In some circumstances you may have the right to restrict how your child’s/guardian personal data is processed.

**Portability**

In some circumstances you may have the right to request the personal data given to us in a machine-readable format.
