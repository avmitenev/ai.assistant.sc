**Bundled Solutions:**

1. Each of our Bundled products is individually available. If you have opened a current account as part of your Bundle Solution, you need to channel your salary to this account to fulfil the bundle requirements.

6. You can exit any of the individual constituent products in the Product bundle at any time. If you do not fulfil the terms of the bundle, we will reprice your loan and/or current account. For loan products, we may choose to change the monthly repayment or tenor should the rate on your facility change.

**Savings Accounts and Term Deposits:**

1. The rate of interest for your savings account is not fixed and will vary. The interest rate can be changed by the bank at its sole discretion. The current interest rates are available at any of our branches.
2. Interest earned on your Fixed Deposit will be paid into your Current/Savings Account with the bank depending on the interest payment option you choose at maturity.
3. Interest will accrue based on your daily available balance. Interest is calculated based on 365 days for KES and GBP, and 360 days for all other currencies.
4. The fixed deposit will automatically roll over for a similar period on maturity at prevailing counter rate, unless written instructions are given to the contrary.
5. Terminating or cancelling the Fixed Deposit/High Yield account before maturity is not advisable. If you do break the deposit before maturity, the bank will not pay the accrued interest. In the event that interest has been paid before maturity, the bank will deduct the paid interest from the principal. Any tax paid on this interest by the bank, on your behalf, will need to be recovered by you from the relevant tax authority.

**Current Accounts:**

Your current account will earn no interest and services will be charged as per the applicable tariff guide.

**Overdraft:**

Interest is applied on the daily outstanding overdraft balance multiplied by the number of days the overdraft facility has been utilized. Interest is calculated based on a 365 day year.

**Instalment Loans: [Personal Loans, Mortgages and Auto Loans]**

1. Interest is applied on a daily balance basis and is calculated based on a 360 day year for each of the respective loan products.
2. The arrangement fee is a percentage on the loan amount approved. If you are topping up your loan, the arrangement fee charged will be dependent on the balance of your existing loan on the day of disbursement.
3. The interest rate applicable on your mortgage at the time of origination will be the rate mentioned in the Banking Facility Letter. The pricing on the Banking Facility Letter will be valid only for 30 days within which the offer needs to be accepted and returned to the bank.
4. The interest rate on your Instalment Loans [Personal Loan, Mortgage Loan and/or Auto Loan] can be varied based on any changes in the Base Rate set out in our approval or any other rate we determine from time to time or changes made to the margin by law or by the bank. When we change the pricing on your loan, we may choose to do so by either changing the instalment or tenor of the loan.
5. We will debit your Current/Savings account for the instalment amount on the instalment due date. If yours is a scheme loan, your employer will deduct the monthly instalment from your salary and remit the funds to your loan account at Standard Chartered Bank. (Please note that this repayment arrangement cannot be cancelled without the Bank’s express instruction).
6. Your loan facility is subject to interest from the day it has been disbursed. If the first instalment is more than 30 days after the date of disbursal of the loan, then the interest for the period greater than 30 days will be accrued and collected as part of the last instalment.
7. In case of prepayment, the bank will apply the overpaid amount towards the loan outstanding as principal reduction. Please note that the overpaid amount will not earn interest for the period that the money has not been posted into your loan account to reduce the loan principal.
8. If you are offered a foreign currency loan facility and you no longer earn in foreign currency, we will convert the loan facility to Kenya Shillings at the exchange rate on the day the loan is converted with prior notice to you.

4. **Risk Disclosure:** You are aware that Foreign Currency lending may be priced with reference to a benchmark rate. There is a risk that such benchmark rate may be discontinued, or the methodology, formula or other means of determining such benchmark rate may materially change to make it no longer appropriate for the purposes of calculating interest, prior to the termination of any such credit facility or the maturity of loans under such credit facility. If such benchmark rate is discontinued or no longer appropriate for the purposes of calculating interest, the Bank may substitute that benchmark rate with a standard market interest rate (please see Clause 36.18 of the Client Terms). If a substitute interest rate is used, it is possible that such substitute interest rate may result in a change to the amounts that would otherwise have been payable under the credit facilities and the methodology of calculation with respect to the substitute interest rate may change relative to the methodology of calculation for the original benchmark rate. Timing for the discontinuation of different benchmark rates may differ. In addition, the discontinuation of a benchmark rate may result in a mismatch between the interest rate of a credit facility and other financial instruments, including potentially those that are intended as hedges.
