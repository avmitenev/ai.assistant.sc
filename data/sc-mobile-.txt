    We have adopted comprehensive security measures to safeguard your use of the SC Mobile App.
    
    Customer Authentication with Login ID and Password – You must enter the unique Login ID and Password to access Online Banking. All information transmitted through the Internet, including your Login ID, Password, your account information and your transaction details, from the moment you log in to the time you log out, are protected by strong end-to-end 128 bit SSL encryption; i.e. from your PC browser to the Bank’s system.
    
    2-Factor Authentication for transactions – All financial transactions and personal updates on Online Banking require a 2-factor authentication process. This means that in addition to your usual login credentials, we will send a temporary one-time SMS pass code to your registered mobile number in order for you to complete the transaction. This process ensures that only you, as the account holder, will be authorised to carry out transactions on your account.
    
    Automatic Logout – To prevent unauthorized access at your PC while it is unattended, we have implemented a time-out feature. Your login session of Online Banking will be terminated if the browser is left idle for a while.
