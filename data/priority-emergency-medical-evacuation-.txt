* Can I subscribe to the service if I do not have an existing medical Insurance?

    Yes. However, upon being evacuated to the hospital, you will be required to pay for the medical costs as directed by the hospital in cash since the Maisha Ambulance cover does not constitute a medical insurance cover.

* At what point does AMREF obligation end, once the evacuation has started?

    AMREF Flying Doctors will liaise with hospitals and doctors where necessary to make the medical evacuation as smooth and swift as possible. AMREF can also assist in arranging hospital admission and will take the patient from the airport to the hospital of the client’s choice in Nairobi. However, AMREF Flying Doctors does not accept any responsibility for hospital payments or other related medical expenses.

* Do you allow an evacuee to fly with a next-of-kin where a third party has to assist with hospital procedures?

    Yes, subject to availability of space in the aircraft at the discretion of AMREF.

* What if I am not close to any airport?

    AMREF keep a current database of all serviced airports and airstrips all over the East Africa region and will endeavour to pick a patient from the closest airstrip. If medical ground transport is not available at the location of the patient, AMREF can assist in arranging the same.

* What kind of medical care/support can I expect during the evacuation?

    AMREF Flying Doctors aircraft and ground ambulances are fitted with intensive care medical equipment. Highly qualified and experienced medical personnel will accompany each evacuation flight. From the time AMREF pick you to the time you’re admitted to the hospital, you will be in the professional hands of the AMREF medical team.

* What medical condition warrants an air evacuation under the Maisha scheme?

    AMREF Flying Doctors will provide its best effort to assist any patient in need. AMREF medical staff in the AMREF 24-hour Emergency Control Centre will assess each evacuation request. This assessment may include a conversation with the patient’s treating doctor, an official at the site of the accident, or a next of kin who is with the patient in order to establish the nature and extent of the illness/injury. Any patient with an acute and serious medical condition will be evacuated by Air Ambulance to Nairobi. In cases that are not critical, AMREF Flying Doctors reserves the right to refer patients to a nearby medical facility/doctor where applicable. In cases where the medical condition does not warrant an air evacuation, patients can still be evacuated against payment.

* How long does it take for AMREF Flying Doctors to mobilise an Air Ambulance?

    AMREF endeavour to dispatch an Air Ambulance as fast as possible. When a call for assistance is received at AMREF, the staff will immediately start to work on the case, providing first aid medical advice or give direction to the closest medical facility where applicable, collect information about the patient’s condition, the location, details of the nearest airstrip and validity of the Maisha cover, etc. In cases of cross-border operations, flight clearances will also be obtained.

    While all this is going on, the caller will be kept updated and informed of the aircraft’s arrival time as soon as possible. The actual mobilisation of the aircraft and crew can be as fast as 20 minutes from the time of the call. However, as outlined above, certain logistical and aviation requirements that are necessary to provide a successful evacuation flight can take additional time.

* Is there a limit to the number of times one can be evacuated during a subscription year?

    No. During the subscription period, Maisha policy holders are entitled to unlimited medical emergency air evacuations.

* Are there any hidden costs over and above the Maisha subscription fee?
