The above disclosures may require the transfer of your information to parties located in countries outside Kenya. We will ensure that parties to whom your details are transferred treat your information securely and confidentially. We also pledge our intention fully to meet any internationally recognised standards of personal data privacy protection and to comply with applicable data protection and privacy laws. We may transfer your information if it is necessary to perform our contract with you and by providing details to us via the SC JUZA App you are deemed to consent to any other transfers.

**Security**

The security of your personal data is important to us. We have technical and organisational security measures in place to safeguard your personal data. When using external service providers, we require that they adhere to security standards mandated by us. We may do this through contractual provisions, including any required by a privacy regulator, and oversight of the service provider. Regardless of where personal data is transferred, we take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that personal data is kept securely.

You should be aware that electronic communication is not a secure form of communication and sending us any personal data electronically carries with it risks including the risk of access and interference by unauthorised third parties. Information passing over the Internet may be transmitted internationally (even when sender and recipient are located in the same country) via countries with weaker privacy and data protection laws than in your country of residence.

**Retention**

Information held about you is retained as long as the purpose for which the information was collected continues or as required under regulatory requirements. The information is then destroyed unless its retention is required to satisfy legal, regulatory, or accounting requirements or to protect Bank’s interests. In the majority of cases, the information will be retained for seven years from the end of your relationship with us.

It is your responsibility to maintain the secrecy of any user login password you hold for this SC JUZA App.

**Monitoring**

To the extent permitted by law, we may record and monitor your electronic communications with us to ensure compliance with our legal and regulatory obligations and internal policies for the purposes outlined above.

**Automated decisions and profiling**

We may use profiling, including behavioural analysis, to assist us to provide you with better services, to make decisions and to prevent money laundering, terrorism, fraud and other financial crime. If any profiling will result in an automated decision relating to you, we will let you know, and you will have the right to discuss the decision with us.

**Marketing and Push Notifications**

We may use your Personal Data:

1. to conduct market research and surveys with the aim of improving our products and services;
2. for marketing purposes, promotional events, competitions, and lucky draws**.

We may also occasionally send you push notifications through the SC JUZA mobile application to send you marketing messages and other Service or transaction-related notifications that may be of importance to you. We process your Personal Data for these purposes because it is in the interest of our business to do so with the intention of improving our products and services and generating business. We will not send you marketing material if you have specifically asked us not to do so.

You have the right, at any time, to opt-out from receiving these types of communications by turning them off at the device level through your settings or through the mobile application settings. You may also contact us through the Chat Service available on the SC JUZA App.
